# uploading-to-MapMyRun

script for uploading .tcx files to MapMyRun via selenium

with the retirement of the Endomodo app, users are being directed to MapMyRun.
I had previously downloaded all of my workouts as .tcx files, and I upload
them here to MapMyRun in order to get stats and have them available to browse
on the app

recall that selenium requires a webdriver (such as gecko for firefox), which
needs to be downloaded, unzipped, and put into /usr/local/bin/

buttons were identified using the xPath Finder add-on for Firefox
